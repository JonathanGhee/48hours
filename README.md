npm install before you begin!

to start up client, make sure you are in the home directory, then use

  npm run build:dev
  npm run serve

Before you start up the server, you have to create a mongoDB locally.
I used MongoDB Compass on Windows to create it. This is just my personal preference
to use GUIs whenever I can. You can use Homebrew on Mac/Linux/WSL2 to install mongoDB
https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew, or directly https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/.


Once you are set up, change -> 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mvp' in database/index.js to whatever you named your
database. 27017 is the default port.


To start up server, first change directory into server, and

npm install
npm run start
